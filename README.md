## Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile and complex nature of financial markets. This project aims to use LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network, to model the temporal dependencies in stock price data and make accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess stock price data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Select and engineer features for model training.
- **LSTM Model Implementation**: Build and train LSTM models for time series forecasting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot stock prices and prediction results for analysis.
- **Web Application**: A web interface for real-time stock price prediction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock_price_prediction_lstm.git
   cd stock_price_prediction_lstm

2. Install the required packages in the requirements.txt file:
   
       pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To directly access the website paste this link on your browser:

Else to run the the project form terminal type in this on your directory:

    streamlit run web_app.py

If you wish to train the entire model from strach then do the following steps

- **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly in Stock_Symbols.csv
- **Model Preparation**: Open the Jupter Notebook and change the model name and then run it and once it is completed you will have       your final model
